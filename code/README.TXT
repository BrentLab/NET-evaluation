There are three ways for evaluating regulatory networks with binding data, and all of them assume that the fraction of regulators having ChIP-Seq data is representative sample for these regulators that do not have ChIP-Seq experiments. Here, we describe these methods:

For all these method, the absolute value for edges scores are taken, then ranked from highest to lowest.
- NO filtering: coded in evaluate_with_binding_1.py. This method is used np2 paper. Let's say if we have a total of 200 regulators in our network, the size of the first bin (5 targets  per regulator) is (5 * 200) = 1000 edges. Let's say only 400 edges are supproted, and only 800 edges can be evaluated. The percentage of supported edges is 400*100/800=50% of edges. Only 800 edges can be evaluated because the remaining 200 edges are for regulators that do not have ChIP-Seq experiments/data.
- With filtering & with rescaling the bin size: coded in evaluate_with_binding_2.py. This method is my first modification for the evaluation metric. After ranking all edges in the network, we exclude all ones that do not have ChIP-Seq experiments. To calculate the percentage of binding support, let's say only 150 out of these 200 regulator have ChIP-Seq experiments. The size of the first bin (5 targets per regulator) will (5 * 150) = 750. Let's say 350 of them have binding support, the percentage of supported edges is 350*100/750=47%.
- With filtering & without rescaling the bin size: coded in evaluate_with_binding.py. This method is after my second discussion with Michael. After ranking all edges in the network, we exclude all ones that do not have ChIP-Seq experiments. To calculate the percentage of binding support, even if only 150 out of these 200 regulator have ChIP-Seq experiments, we keep size of the first bin (5 targets per regulator) computed as we have ChIP-Seq experiments with all 200 regualtors will (5 * 200) = 1000. Let's say 550 of them have binding support, the percentage of supported edges is 550*100/1000=55%.
